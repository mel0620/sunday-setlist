# Sunday Setlist PWA

A modern, responsive Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help church worship teams and service leaders organize and view their Sunday setlists. This application provides a public, view-only interface for all users and a secure, login-protected area for Songleaders and MCs to create, update, and manage setlists.

Built with vanilla HTML, Tailwind CSS, and plain JavaScript, and powered by a Firebase backend for real-time data and authentication.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Updates:** Using Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener, any changes made to a setlist are reflected instantly for all users without needing a page refresh.
- **Enhanced Offline Viewing:** Through a service worker, the app caches all essential files and the latest setlist data. Users can view previously loaded setlists even if they lose their internet connection.
- **Public Viewing:** Anyone can visit the app and instantly see the latest setlist and a history of past setlists.
- **Role-Based Input:** Once logged in, users select their role ("Songleader" or "MC") to see a form tailored to their specific needs.
- **Ordered Categories:** Song categories for both Songleaders and MCs are always displayed in a predefined, logical order.
- **Detailed Song Entries:** Users can input song titles, YouTube/Spotify links, musical key, BPM, lyrics, chords, and sequence/flow notes.
- **View Modals:** On-demand pop-up modals to cleanly display a song's Lyrics, Chords, or Sequence.
- **Sticky Header:** The main header stays fixed to the top for easy access to login/logout buttons while scrolling.
- **Grouped Setlists:** Setlists for the most recent date are grouped together under a "Latest Setlist" heading.
- **Paginated History:** Older setlists are neatly organized into pages to keep the interface clean and fast.
- **Live Search:** Instantly filter all setlists by song title, leader's name, or role.
- **Automatic Dark Mode:** Adapts to the user's system preference for a light or dark theme.
- **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first design that looks great on any device, from phones to desktops.
